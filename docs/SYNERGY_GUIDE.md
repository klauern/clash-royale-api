## What is Synergy?

**Synergy** is when cards work exceptionally well together, creating effects that wouldn't be possible with either card alone. Synergistic decks are more consistent, powerful, and fun to play.

### Why Synergy Matters

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Consistency** | Cards reinforce each other's strengths |
| **Power Spikes** | Create overwhelming advantages |
| **Flexibility** | Multiple win conditions from same cards |
| **Predictability** | Know what your deck can do |

## Synergy Categories

### 1. Tank + Support (High Synergy)

**Pattern:** High HP tank absorbs damage while support troops deal DPS.

| Tank | Support | Synergy Score | Why It Works |
|------|---------|---------------|--------------|
| Golem | Night Witch | 0.95 | Bats from death DPS while Golem tanks |
| Golem | Lumberjack | 0.90 | Rage increases Golem's already-high DPS |
| Giant | Wizard | 0.85 | Wizard behind Giant is protected |
| Giant | Witch | 0.85 | Skeletons tank while Giant hits tower |
| Lava Hound | Baby Dragon | 0.90 | Splash clears while Hound tanks tower |
| Royal Giant | Musketeer | 0.80 | Simple but effective support |

**Key Insight:** The tank should reach the tower while support survives to DPS.

### 2. Win Condition Combinations (High Synergy)

**Pattern:** Cards that together create an unstoppable push.

| Card 1 | Card 2 | Synergy Score | Why It Works |
|--------|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Lava Hound | Balloon | 0.95 | Balloon shines when Hound draws air defense |
| Graveyard | Freeze | 0.90 | Freeze prevents clearing while Grim spawns |
| Golem | Electro Giant | 0.85 | Double tanks overwhelm single-target defenses |
| X-Bow | Tesla | 0.85 | Tesla protects X-Bow from being rushed |
| Hog Rider | Ice Golem | 0.80 | Ice Golem clears mini-tanks for Hog |

**Key Insight:** Timing matters - deploy support so it arrives together with win condition.

### 3. Spell Bait (High Synergy)

**Pattern:** Cards that force opponent to use spells, creating openings for the real threat.

| Bait Card | Punishment | Synergy Score |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Goblin Barrel | Princess | 0.95 |
| Princess | Goblin Barrel | 0.95 |
| Goblin Gang | Log + Barrel | 0.90 |
| Dart Goblin | Goblin Barrel | 0.85 |
| Skeleton Army | Graveyard | 0.85 |

**Key Insight:** Bait works when opponent feels forced to spell. If they don't, punish them.

### 4. Spell Combinations (Medium-High Synergy)

**Pattern:** Spells that together accomplish what neither can alone.

| Spell 1 | Spell 2 | Target | Synergy Score |
|---------|---------|--------|---------------|
| Tornado | Fireball | Clustered troops | 0.85 |
| Tornado | Poison | Large area denial | 0.85 |
| Zap | Fireball | Medium HP troops | 0.80 |
| Poison | Graveyard | Tower defense denial | 0.80 |
| Freeze | Any | Tower damage extension | 0.75 |

**Key Insight:** Tornado's power is pulling troops together for maximum value.

### 5. Defensive Cores (Medium Synergy)

**Pattern:** Building + troops that create positive elixir trades.

| Building | Support | Synergy Score | Why It Works |
|----------|---------|---------------|--------------|
| Inferno Tower | Tornado | 0.85 | Pull tanks into beam, reset charges |
| Tesla | Tornado | 0.80 | Pull troops into hidden Tesla damage |
| Cannon | Skeletons | 0.75 | Cheap defense combination |
| Tombstone | Ice Spirit | 0.75 | Cycle chips while Tombstone spawns |
| Goblin Cage | Anything | 0.70 | Free Brawler on defense |

**Key Insight:** Defensive synergies are about elixir efficiency, not damage.

### 6. Bridge Spam (Medium Synergy)

**Pattern:** Multiple medium-cost cards that create overwhelming pressure.

| Card 1 | Card 2 | Card 3 | Synergy Score |
|--------|--------|--------|---------------|
| Battle Ram | Bandit | Mega Knight | 0.85 |
| P.E.K.K.A | Battle Ram | Electro Wizard | 0.85 |
| Royal Giant | Elite Barbarians | Bandit | 0.80 |

**Key Insight:** Bridge spam works by overwhelming single-target defenses with multiple threats.

### 7. Cycle Synergies (Medium Synergy)

**Pattern:** Low-cost cards that enable fast deck rotation.

| Card 1 | Card 2 | Synergy Score |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Ice Spirit | Skeletons | 0.85 |
| Ice Spirit | Bats | 0.85 |
| Skeletons | Bats | 0.80 |
| Ice Spirit | Knight | 0.75 |

**Key Insight:** Cycle synergies enable reaching win condition more frequently.

## Building Synergistic Decks

### Step 1: Choose Your Core Synergy

Start with 2-3 cards that form a strong core:

| Core Type | Example | Strength |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Tank + Support | Golem + Night Witch | Beatdown |
| Win Con Combo | Lava Hound + Balloon | Air beatdown |
| Spell Bait | Goblin Barrel + Princess | Bait cycle |
| Bridge Spam | P.E.K.K.A + Battle Ram | Fast pressure |

### Step 2: Add Complementary Cards

Fill remaining slots with cards that:

1. **Defend against core weaknesses** (air defense for ground decks)
2. **Provide spell value** (Fireball, Zap, etc.)
3. **Enable the core** (Tornado for tank positioning)
4. **Create secondary win conditions** (don't be one-dimensional)

### Step 3: Verify Coverage

Use the WASTED framework:
- **W**in Condition: Can you damage towers?
- **A**ir Defense: 2+ air targeting cards
- **S**plash: 2+ splash damage sources
- **T**ank Killer: High DPS for tanks
- **E**lixir Management: Pump or efficient cycle
- **D**efense: Building or defensive troops

## Common Synergy Patterns

### The "LavaLoon" Pattern

```
Lava Hound (tank)
├── Balloon (win condition, arrives with Hound)
├── Tornado (pulls air defense into Balloon)
└── Ice Wizard (slows defenders, chips damage)

Support:
├── Arrows (clears Minion Horde)
├── Mega Minion (anti-air DPS)
└── [Your choice]
```

**Why It Works:** Hound tanks tower and draws air defense → Balloon reaches tower → Tornado repositions defenders → Tower damage.

### The "Golem Beatdown" Pattern

```
Golem (tank)
├── Night Witch (bats DPS + death spawn)
├── Tornado (pulls defenders into Golem/death spawn)
└── Log (clears swarms)

Support:
├── Electro Giant (shock damage, secondary tank)
├── Lightning (removes Inferno Tower)
└── [Your choice]
```

**Why It Works:** Golem dies → Night Witch dies → 20+ bats overwhelm defenses. Tornado positions troops for death value.

### The "Log Bait" Pattern

```
Goblin Barrel (primary win condition)
├── Princess (bait for Log)
├── Goblin Gang (bait for Log)
└── Dart Goblin (bait for Log)

Support:
├── Cannon (Hog defense)
├── Ice Spirit (cycle chip)
└── [Your choice]
```

**Why It Works:** Opponent must Log Princess/Gang → Barrel is unanswerable → win.

## Detecting Synergies

### Using the CLI

The deck builder automatically detects synergies:

```bash
# Build with verbose output to see synergies
./bin/cr-api deck build --tag '#PLAYERTAG' --verbose

# Evaluate existing deck for synergies
./bin/cr-api deck evaluate --deck "Hog,Ice Golem,Musketeer,Log,Zap,Cannon,Skeletons,Ice Spirit" --verbose
```

### Synergy Scores

The evaluation system assigns synergy scores:
- **0.90-1.00**: Exceptional synergy (top-tier combinations)
- **0.75-0.89**: Strong synergy (competitive combinations)
- **0.60-0.74**: Moderate synergy (workable combinations)
- **< 0.60**: Weak or no synergy (cards don't work well together)

### Multi-Card Synergies

Beyond pairs, the system detects:
- **3+ card archetypes**: Complete strategic packages
- **Win condition packages**: Full offensive systems
- **Defensive cores**: Building + support + spell

## Advanced Synergy Concepts

### Anti-Synergies to Avoid

Some cards **don't** work well together:

| Card 1 | Card 2 | Why It's Bad |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Golem | Hog Rider | Conflicting win conditions |
| X-Bow | Giant | Siege vs beatdown conflict |
| 3+ Buildings | Anything | Too defensive, no pressure |
| 4+ Spells | Anything | Can't defend troops |
| No Win Condition | Anything | Can't damage towers |

### Hidden Synergies

Less obvious but powerful:

- **Evolution synergies**: Evolved cards often have enhanced synergies
- **Level synergies**: Overleveled cards amplify synergy effects
- **Meta synergies**: Cards that counter the current meta together
