# Testing Guide

## Running Tests

```bash
task test                # Run all tests
task test:integration    # Run integration tests only
task test:coverage       # Generate coverage report
```

## Rules

- **Always** run tests before marking tasks complete
- Check for broken links after moving documentation
- Integration tests require valid `CLASH_ROYALE_API_TOKEN` in `.env`

## Patterns

**Test organization:**
- Unit tests: `*_test.go` alongside source files
- Integration tests: `integration_*_test.go` in root
- Test fixtures: `internal/storage/testdata/`

**Coverage:**
- Run `task test:coverage` to view coverage report
- Coverage reports: `coverage.html`, `coverage.out`
