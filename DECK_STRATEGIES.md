### Mulligan Guide (Opening Plays)

- **Why:** Force early defense, prevent elixir buildup
- **Follow-up:** Skeleton Dragons opposite lane if they ignore
- **Key Cards:** Cannon (kiting), Skeleton Dragons (air defense)

**VS Hog Cycle / Fast Cycle:**
- **Opening:** Cannon in center (4 tiles from river)
- **Why:** Ready for first Hog push
- **Follow-up:** Fire Spirit in back to start cycling
- **Key Cards:** Cannon every rotation, Goblin Gang to swarm Hog

**VS Bridge Spam (Battle Ram, Bandit):**
- **Opening:** Archers in back
- **Why:** Ranged defense for both lanes
- **Follow-up:** Goblin Gang for swarm defense
- **Key Cards:** Goblin Gang, Skeleton Dragons

**VS Control/Spell Bait:**
- **Opening:** Fire Spirit in back
- **Why:** Cheap cycle, scout their archetype
- **Follow-up:** Mirror their tempo
- **Key Cards:** Save Fireball for Princess/swarms

**VS Siege (X-Bow, Mortar):**
- **Opening:** Goblin Gang at bridge IMMEDIATELY
- **Why:** Prevent siege lock on tower
- **Follow-up:** Skeleton Dragons same lane to destroy siege
- **Key Cards:** Goblin Barrel opposite lane when they place siege

**VS Unknown:**
- **Opening:** Archers in back OR Fire Spirit in back
- **Why:** Safe, gives elixir advantage
- **Follow-up:** React defensively to their first play
- **Key Cards:** Hold spells until you identify threats

**❌ NEVER Open With:**
- Goblin Barrel (telegraphs win condition)
- Fireball (no value)
- Zap (wastes cycle)
- Cannon (reactive only)

### Game Plan by Phase

**Opening (0:00 - 1:00)**
1. Deploy Goblin Gang at bridge to scout opponent's spell
2. Learn their counter (Zap, Log, Arrows, Barbarian Barrel)
3. Build elixir advantage with defensive Skeleton Dragons/Archers
4. **DO NOT** throw Goblin Barrel yet

**Mid-Game (1:00 - 2:00)**
5. Deploy Goblin Gang on defense when they push
6. **IMMEDIATELY** throw Goblin Barrel opposite lane when they use spell
7. Predict their spell timing (if they Zapped at 1:15, expect it again at 1:20)
8. Use Cannon + high-level troops to defend efficiently

**Double Elixir (2:00 - 3:00)**
9. Spam Goblin Barrel opposite lane when they commit heavy troops
10. Cycle Fire Spirit + Goblin Barrel for quick 4-elixir pressure
11. Your level 10-11 defensive cards hold easily
12. **Key:** If they have 3 elixir and Barrel is 3 elixir, they can't defend + counter-push

**Overtime**
- Goblin Barrel + Zap on their tower (5 elixir)
- Defend with Skeleton Dragons + Archers
- Cycle faster than they can respond

### Advanced Techniques

**Goblin Barrel Placements:**
- **Standard:** Top corner (hardest to react to)
- **Early game:** Center to scout their timing
- **Prediction:** If they Log every time, throw Barrel early
- **Late game:** Alternate corners to break their muscle memory

**Bait Sequences:**
1. Goblin Gang on defense → Barrel opposite lane
2. Skeleton Dragons tank spell → Barrel same lane
3. Archers split lane → Barrel when they commit one side

**Spell Management:**
- **Zap:** Save for swarms defending Barrel (Skeleton Army, Minions)
- **Fireball:** Princess, Wizard, Pump, defensive buildings
- **Never:** Waste spells on King Tower chip damage

### Matchup-Specific Tips

**VS Spell-Heavy Decks (Lightning, Rocket):**
- Spread troops, never clump
- Bait big spell with Skeleton Dragons, then Barrel opposite
- Accept some chip damage, focus on Barrel connections

**VS Log Bait (Princess, Goblin Gang, Goblin Barrel):**
- Save Zap for their Barrel
- Use Fireball on Princess + tower for value
- Barrel when their Log is out of rotation

**VS Beatdown:**
- Goblin Gang + Skeleton Dragons defend 10+ elixir pushes
- Barrel opposite lane constantly
- Cannon kites tanks away from tower

**VS Hog Cycle:**
- Cannon + Goblin Gang shuts down Hog completely
- Out-cycle their Cannon with Fire Spirit
- Barrel when they Hog opposite lane

### Upgrade Priority

**Immediate (Request Daily):**
1. **Goblin Gang** (11→12): 274/3000 cards - Your strongest, keep maxing
2. **Archers** (10→11): 0/2000 cards - Core support
3. **Fire Spirit** (10→11): 404/2000 cards - Cycle card

**Short-Term (2-4 Weeks):**
1. **Fireball** (8→9): Critical spell, need 800 cards
2. **Cannon** (9→10): 560/1000 cards - Defensive anchor
3. **Zap** (10→11): Core spell, 2000 cards needed

**Long-Term:**
1. **Skeleton Dragons** (11→12): Secondary win condition
2. **Goblin Barrel** (4→5): Expensive Epic, slow upgrade

⚠️ **Trade-off:** Hog level 6 is underleveled for your trophy range

### Core Strategy

2. Counter-push with Hog + Fire Spirit (5 elixir)
3. Cycle back to Hog before they cycle to counter
4. Repeat until tower falls

**Defensive Discipline:**
- Cannon pulls tanks, saves tower health
- Musketeer DPS on tanks/air
- Knight tanks for Musketeer
- Skeletons surround single-target troops

**❌ NEVER Open With:** Fireball, Zap, Musketeer (spell value), Cannon (reactive only)

### Game Plan

**Opening (0:00 - 1:00)**
1. Skeletons/Fire Spirit in back to start cycle
2. Scout their counters to Hog (buildings, swarms)
3. Test with Hog + Fire Spirit at bridge

**Mid-Game (1:00 - 2:00)**
4. Defend with Cannon + Knight/Musketeer
5. Hog opposite lane when they commit
6. Prediction Fireball on their defensive building
7. Cycle faster than they can defend

**Double Elixir (2:00 - 3:00)**
8. Hog + Fire Spirit EVERY rotation

10. Out-cycle their counters (you're 2.75, they're likely 3.5+)

**Overtime**

- Skeletons + Knight defend their counter-push
- Cycle speed wins

### Advanced Techniques

**Hog Placements:**
- **Standard:** 2 tiles from bridge (hardest to counter)
- **Prediction:** Place early if they always Cannon same spot
- **Bypass:** Place high to bypass buildings in center

**Cycle Optimization:**
- After defending, play cheapest card FIRST (Skeletons/Fire Spirit)
- Get back to Hog faster than opponent gets to counter
- Count elixir: If you're at 10 and they're at 4, GO AGGRESSIVE

**Fireball Value:**
- Pump + tower
- Musketeer/Wizard + tower
- Defensive building + support troop
- **Never:** Random tower chip (waste 4 elixir)

### Upgrade Priority

**Immediate:**
1. **Hog Rider** (6→7): 16/200 cards - **CRITICAL UPGRADE**
2. **Knight** (8→9): 323/800 cards - Close to level up!
3. **Musketeer** (7→8): 75/400 cards - Request daily

**Short-Term:**
1. **Fireball** (8→9): Essential spell upgrade
2. **Hog Rider** (7→8): Keep pushing to competitive level

⚠️ **Trade-off:** Slightly slower than other aggressive decks

### Core Strategy

3. Support with Musketeer/Goblin Gang behind

**Defensive Value:**
- Goblin Cage destroys and spawns Brawler
- Brawler (3 elixir value) joins counter-push for FREE

**Battle Ram Synergies:**

## 🧠 Mental Game Tips

### Your Aggressive Advantage
**82.7% three-crown rate means:**
- Most players at 2841 play defensive
- Your aggression catches them off-guard
- **Confidence:** You FINISH games when ahead

**Leverage This:**
1. Apply pressure EARLY (first 30 seconds)
2. Force them to react, not build
3. Trust your high-level defensive cards

### When Losing
**Common Mistakes:**
- Playing TOO aggressive when behind
- Throwing Barrel desperately
- Ignoring defense to spam offense

**Instead:**
1. Defend efficiently ONE push
2. Small elixir advantage
3. THEN counter-push
4. Your cycle speed allows comeback

### Tilt Management
**If you lose 2 in a row:**
1. Take 5-minute break
2. Watch a replay: "What could I have defended better?"
3. Come back with fresh mind

**Remember:**
- 51% win rate means you lose HALF your games
- Losses are learning opportunities
- Your aggressive style WILL lose to hard counters (that's okay)
