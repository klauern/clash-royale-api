## Mulligan Guide (All Cycle Decks)

**VS Beatdown (Giant, Golem):** Opening play to force defense, hold counter for their push
**VS Hog/Fast Cycle:** Reactive defense ready, cheap cycle to start
**VS Bridge Spam:** Ranged defense in back, swarm ready
**VS Siege (X-Bow, Mortar):** Immediate pressure at bridge, prevent lock
**VS Control:** Cheap cycle in back, scout archetype
**VS Unknown:** Safe cycle card in back

**❌ NEVER Open With:** Win condition alone, spells for no value, reactive buildings

---

## Game Plan (All Cycle Decks)

**Opening (0:00 - 1:00):** Start cycle, scout opponent's counters, test pressure
**Mid-Game (1:00 - 2:00):** Defend efficiently, counter opposite lane, predict spells
**Double Elixir (2:00 - 3:00):** Aggressive cycling, spam win condition when they commit
**Overtime:** Fastest cycling wins, pressure constantly

---

## Advanced Techniques

**Win Condition Placements:** Standard corner (hardest to react), prediction placement if they counter same spot, alternate corners late game

**Cycle Optimization:** Play cheapest card FIRST after defending, count opponent elixir, go aggressive when you have advantage

**Spell Value:** Pump + tower, support troop + tower, defensive building + support. Never random tower chip

---
